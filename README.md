# kanbas-node-server-app-cs4550-01

The website is hosted on Netlify found here: https://marvelous-arithmetic-aef716.netlify.app/

The corresponding REACT Web App can be found here: https://github.com/shoti411/kanbas-react-web-app

This server was created using NodeJS in JavaScript. The database being connected to is MongoDB, and it must be turned on to implement the CRUD operation functionality of the website.

The Kanbas database and the Project database are different, so to successfully add data to either Kanbas or the Project, the base APIs must be changed to reflect the different database.
